## Ruleset Summary
 
A new spin on Super Kaizo. As opposed to increasing difficulty, this serves as an alternative approach.

Pre-Safari remains virtually unchanged, the only differences are quality of life improvements to make pivoting more enjoyable.

The major shift happens at the Safari Zone. You now engage in Safari 'Recruitment' where you keep your original Pokémon and find a new team member.

Once both Pokémon are ready, a special NPC switches all remaining trainers to doubles battles and adds an extra Pokémon to their team where possible. From then on, you'll be playing Super Kaizo Doubles. 



## General Rules for All Games

0. All other [Super Kaizo rules](https://github.com/PyroMikeGit/SuperKaizoIronMON/blob/main/README.md) apply. (unless overridden by a Duper rule below)!
1. A new NPC has been added outside the Safari zone, speaking to them will convert all unfought trainers to Double Battles and where able, will add an additional Pokémon to their team. [ROM patch](Coming Soon)
2. You are no longer required to pivot at the Safari zone. Instead, you must 'recruit' a second Pokémon to your team. This follows the exact same rules and structure as Super Kaizo pivoting, including the ability to do early Koga and Blaine. You now commit to your finished doubles team by interacting with the aforementioned NPC. (There is no going back, so only switch to doubles when you are truly prepared!)  
3. You may reenter each Dungeon one additional time, however, you must have enabled doubles mode before doing so.
4. ALL banned moves may be used while labbing and pivoting. The normal restrictions on moves apply once you begin the first non-rival battle.
5. Early pivoting is not restricted to one Pokémon per area. You now have a game specific amount of pivots that can be used across all starter areas. For instance, in FRLG you may pivot a total of 4 times across the 4 locations. You still may not catch the same mon multiple times from a single patch of grass to reroll natures, IVS or abilities. 


## Doubles Rules

0. These rules apply the instant you have utilised the Safari NPC and locked in your team. 
1. Double Battles only! All trainer battles possible are doubles battles (2v2). Thus, if either of your two Pokémon faint it's game over and the run ends.
2. Both of your Pokémon must be different. If evolving a Pokémon results in having two of the same, that's allowed and bypasses this rule.
3. If a move is shared between both your Pokémon, you cannot use that move at all for either of them.
For example, if both Pokémon have Water Spout, then neither Pokémon can use the move Water Spout until one of them forgets it.
5. You may not use the move Transform on your own party members.
6. You may only use items on a Pokémon on that Pokémons turn.
For example, I have a Blastoise and Charizard. I cannot use Blastoises action to use a potion on Charizard, only on itself.
