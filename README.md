## Ruleset Summary
 
A new spin on Super Kaizo. As opposed to increasing difficulty, this serves as an alternative approach.

The early game plays nearly identically, the only major changes are related to pivoting. I am a big fan of pivoting and looking for the best mon in each seed, so I have made some quality of life changes to make the process more enjoyable.

The big difference happens at the Safari Zone. As opposed to being forced to pivot your original Pokémon, you now engage in Safari 'Recruitment'. You keep your original Pokémon and then find a new member in the Safari Zone, once you have both of your teammates, a special NPC will switch the remaining trainers in the game to doubles fights and add an extra Pokémon to their team where possible. From then on, you'll be playing Super Kaizo Doubles until you lose or beat the game.
